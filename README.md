# coding_challenge-11

This coding challenge is all about **working with a designer and building a project for a client as if you just started a development company**. You will have to meet a deadline and finish a website (which you will be able to add to your portfolio) based on the design requirements of the client. A very valuable skill to learn. Let's get started!

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work. At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites on here.

## What is the Challenge?
Here is the story: You just started a freelancing software company: Creative/Inc (original name, I know). You just hired a designer and also got your first client. After meeting with the client, you now have an idea of what they want to build and the designer has sent you some design files in order for you to build the rest of the page. Your challenge is to build the page up using the skills you have learned in the course to get the product finished to the client by the end of the month. Good luck and have fun!  

Ps, a big thank you to my friend Matt from (www.frontendmentor.io) for providing the design files and inspiration for this challenge. 


## The Rules Are:

1. Use the assets in this github repository to finish the client's website so you can make them happy. These are all the files that the designer and the client sent you to finish the website. You will notice that they used HSL color format (https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp).
